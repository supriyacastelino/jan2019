Typical c development environment:
  It shows how a c program works at the end. There are certain steps followed.
Step 1: Editor - here the programmer creates the program in the editor and stores it in a disc.
Step 2: Preprocessor - it is a program that processes the code.
Step 3: Compiler - it creates the object code and stores it in the disc.
Step 4: Linker - it links the object code to the libraries and creates an executable file and stores it on the disc.
Step 5: Loader - it puts the program in the primary memory from the disc.
Step 6: CPU - it takes each instruction from the primary memory and executes it. It also stores new data values as the program executes.
Q1 what do you mean by an object code?
Ans   Object code is the output of a compiler after it processes source code. 
Sourcecode is the version of a computer program as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a human in a programming language.
 A compiler is a specialized program that converts source code into object code.
Q2 what do you mean by the disc ?
Ans  The C drive (C:) is the main hard disk partition which contains the operating system and the related system files.
Q3 what do you mean by primary memory?
Ans  Primary memory is computer memory that a processor or computer accesses first or directly. It allows a processor to access running execution applications and services that are temporarily stored in a specific memory location. Primary memory is also known as primary storage or main memory.
//addition program
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
int a,b,sum;
print f("enter the values of a and b");
scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
sum=a+b;
printf("sum=\n",sum);
}
